## What should work ##

* Display a preview of the editor content in the minimap
* Highlight the viewable part of the editor in the minimap

* Scroll/click in the editor -> scroll in the minimap
* Use the editor colors (syntax, background, selection) in the minimap

## What doesn't work (yet) ##

* Scale the preview of the minimap to display the full content of the editor (big files)
